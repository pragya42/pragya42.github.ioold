            I've never been successful following a TBR. Ussually I just read what's around. Or maybe something cool I randomly found on the internet. And I really don't have many problems with this either. But it might be nice to try having a TBR again. I've decided to read 10 books this month, because I have a 9 day holiday! And I don't know what to do with it â€¦ so much for planning ahead :|
